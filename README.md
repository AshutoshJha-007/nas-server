NAS Server Project

Overview

This project involves building a custom NAS (Network-Attached Storage) server for efficient file storage, sharing, and management. The server is designed to handle various storage needs using both SSD and HDD, while offering secure and remote management options.

Features

Storage Devices:

256 GB SSD

512 GB SSD

Additional HDD storage for expanded capacity

Management Interfaces:

SSH for remote command-line management

GUI for user-friendly interaction

Use Cases:

File sharing

Backups

Media storage and streaming

Challenges Addressed

Limited monitor access resolved through remote SSH setup.

Testing and implementation of robust security measures to ensure data protection.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

A Raspberry Pi with an OS installed (32 GB SD card recommended for the OS).

External storage devices (SSDs and HDDs).

Power supply and necessary cables.

Stable network connection.

Installation

Prepare the Raspberry Pi:

Install the latest Raspberry Pi OS on the SD card.

Configure basic network settings.

Connect Storage Devices:

Attach the 256 GB SSD, 512 GB SSD, and HDD to the Raspberry Pi via USB.

Mount the drives and configure them in /etc/fstab for automatic mounting.

Install Required Software:

Install samba for file sharing:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba

Configure samba for shared access.

Install additional tools as needed, such as rsync for backups.

Set Up Remote Access:

Enable SSH on the Raspberry Pi:

sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh

Install and configure a GUI for easier management, such as OpenMediaVault.

Secure the Server:

Implement a firewall using ufw:

sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable

Set up strong passwords and key-based authentication for SSH.

Testing

Verify that all storage devices are accessible and properly mounted.

Test file sharing by accessing shared directories from another device on the network.

Perform a mock backup and restore to ensure functionality.

Validate all implemented security measures.

Launch Plan

The project will be launched after one week of rigorous security testing. Feedback and suggestions are welcome to further improve the setup.

Future Plans

Expand storage with additional HDDs if needed.

Implement media streaming capabilities.

Explore cloud integration for hybrid storage solutions.
